# Benchmark
I applied the benchmark test written by Mr. Jullien to Easy-ISLisp. 
see bench folder.

# Constraint 
The compiled code of frpoly.lsp does not work properly due to GCC compiler optimization.
Therefore, the compiler version excludes frpoly. 

# Hardware
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz

# EISL Compiler
$ eisl -c -s bench/runbench.lsp
