The Rules of Representing Roman Numerals:

① I, V, X, L, C, D, M represent 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 respectively.

② These characters are combined in writing. 
In this case, larger numbers are written to the left. 
For example, 23 is written as XXIII, and writing XIIXI or similar combinations is incorrect. 
When all numeral symbols are added together, they represent the displayed number.

③ 4 and 9 are written as IV and IX respectively. 
These are numbers obtained by subtracting the left numeral from the right numeral. 
This subtraction rule is only used when the right numeral is exactly 5 times or 10 times the value of the left numeral. 
For instance, 99 is written as XCIX, but writing IC is not permitted.
